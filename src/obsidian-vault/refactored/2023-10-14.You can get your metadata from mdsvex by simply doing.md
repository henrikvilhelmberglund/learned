title: You can get your metadata from mdsvex by simply doing
tags: mdsvex, vite, load function
---

```js
// ... Vite glob import above
for (let path in modules) {
  const post = await modules[path]();
  const metadata = post.metadata;
```

Handy if you want to access title/tags or whatever in your SvelteKit load functions!
