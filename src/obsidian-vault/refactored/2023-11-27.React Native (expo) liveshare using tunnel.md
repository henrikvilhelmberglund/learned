I had an issue when pair programming when we couldn't use the shared server created in Liveshare, it was stuck in a loading state.

The solution was simple: running expo with `expo start --tunnel` creates a tunnel using Ngrok that gave us a link that we could connect to. That way we can pair program while seeing the code on both of our mobiles/emulators. Nice!
