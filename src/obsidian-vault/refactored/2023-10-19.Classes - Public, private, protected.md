title: Classes - Public, private, protected
---

In classes you can have public, private or protected properties/methods.

**Public** means that it is public, you can edit it from outside the class.

**Private** means that it is private, you can't edit it from outside the class.

**Protected** means that it is protected, you can't edit it from outside the class  except if it's in a derived sub class.

Normally you add underscores in front of private/protected properties and use getters/setters to interact with them instead.
