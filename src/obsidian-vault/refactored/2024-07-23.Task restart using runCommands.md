It is possible to restart a task using multicommand in VSCode. First, with a user task:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Install dependencies and start dev",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "ni && d",
      "runOptions": { "runOn": "folderOpen" },
      "group": {
        "kind": "none",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "presentation": {
        "reveal": "always",
        "panel": "shared"
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

This task runs `ni` and `d` which uses [ni](https://github.com/antfu-collective/ni) to install dependencies and then `d` which is an alias for `nr dev` that runs `dev` inside `package.json`. For a guide on how to add aliases see [this](https://tutorials.henrikvilhelmberglund.com/workflow/000%20-%20Add%20aliases%20to%20VSCode%20Git%20Bash%20terminal%20(Windows)).

This task runs when opening a folder. Sometimes you may want to rerun this task, for example after changing a package version in `package.json` and you want to install the new package.

In VSCode open the command palette `Preferences: Open keyboard shortcuts (JSON)` and paste this:

```json
  {
    "key": "f8",
    "command": "runCommands",
    "args": {
      "commands": [
        {
          "command": "workbench.action.tasks.terminate",
          "args": "terminateAll"
        },
        {
          "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
          "args": "Install dependencies and start dev"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

Here I chose f8 to run two commands using `runCommands`: Terminating all tasks first, then running the specified task. It's important that the `args` field has the correct name for the task that you specified in the task label.

When that is done you can press `F8` at any time to close all tasks, and then run the task that installs dependencies and starts the dev server.
