Typescript has something called `type casting` which can be used if you want a more specific type.

For example 

`const myForm = document.querySelector("#my-form");`

would give an `Element` type but maybe we want a more specific type. We could do 
type casting:

`const myForm = document.querySelector("#my-form") as HTMLFormElement;`

If we do this it's more apparent that myForm really is a HTML form element.

We can do the same thing with the `e` in an event callback function which by default has an `any` type. By doing this instead `e: UIEvent` we make it obvious that we're working with some kind of UI event.
