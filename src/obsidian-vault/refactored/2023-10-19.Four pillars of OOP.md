title: Four pillars of OOP
---

There are four pillars of OOP:

1. **Data Hiding:** _Concept:_ Protecting data from direct external access. _In JavaScript:_ Use closures or private variables to limit access to specific properties.
    
2. **Inheritance:** _Concept:_ Creating new objects based on existing ones. _In JavaScript:_ Implement inheritance through prototype chains or ES6 class inheritance.
    
3. **Polymorphism:** _Concept:_ Treating different objects as if they're of a common type. _In JavaScript:_ Achieve polymorphism by method overriding or function overloading.
    
4. **Encapsulation:** _Concept:_ Bundling data and methods into a single unit (class). _In JavaScript:_ Use object literals or class definitions to group related data and functions for clean and modular code.
