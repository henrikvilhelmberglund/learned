I had an issue in Svelte 5 where I tried to use .focus() but it only worked in SSR, not when SSR was disabled.

```ts
const patternSelector = document.querySelector<HTMLButtonElement>("#nejime button")!;
patternSelector.focus();
```

[Dominic from the Svelte team explained that](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/11182#issuecomment-2060703943) SvelteKit tries to restore focus and this conflicted with the focus() I was trying to execute. To fix this I could use queueMicrotask() which makes sure my code runs after SvelteKit is done.

```ts
const patternSelector = document.querySelector<HTMLButtonElement>("#nejime button")!;
queueMicrotask(() => {
  patternSelector.focus();
});
```

Thanks Dominic! ðŸ˜Š
