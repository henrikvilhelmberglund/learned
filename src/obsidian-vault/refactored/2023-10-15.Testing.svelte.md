Since I'm using mdsvex I can also use Svelte code in these posts.

Following taken from mdsvex try page:

## Good stuff in your markdown

Markdown is pretty good but sometimes you just need more.

Sometimes you need a boinger like this:

<Boinger color="{ color }"/>

Not many people have a boinger right in their markdown.

<Seriously>pretty cool!</Seriously>
