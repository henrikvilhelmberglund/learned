title: Using UnoCSS with Tailwind extension

I really like UnoCSS but prefer the Tailwind extension because I find it has better intellisense and a bit better performance. Here's how to use the Tailwind extension together with UnoCSS:

1. Install the Tailwind extension in VSCode.
2. Install the Tailwind package as a dev dependency. `npm i --save-dev tailwindcss` note that we're not really using it, this is just for the extension to start.
3. Add a `tailwind.config.js` (or .ts) file:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
Â  content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js,svelte}"],
};
```

That's it!
