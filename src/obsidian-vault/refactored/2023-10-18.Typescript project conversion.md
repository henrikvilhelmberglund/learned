I converted a project to Typescript (not perfectly but 0 errors at least) and found out some interesting things!

## Async return type

For normal functions you could do something like

`function func(): string {}`

but if it's async you need to surround the type with `Promise<>`

`async function func(): Promise<string> {}`

## Inline type annotation for object

I had an object as a parameter and had to do something like this:

`export function editMode({ selectedList, listItemsUl, API_BASE, headerName }: {selectedList: List, listItemsUl: HTMLUListElement, API_BASE: string, headerName: HTMLDivElement })`

If you're feeling less silly you could do this:

```ts
interface EditModeParams { 
selectedList: List; 
listItemsUl: HTMLUListElement; 
API_BASE: string; 
headerName: HTMLDivElement; } 
```
`export function editMode(params: EditModeParams) {}`

I also had to do this but using `as`, for example

`itemListArray.push({ title: listItemInput.value, checked: false } as {title: string, checked: boolean});`

## Type cast event targets

I found that I had to cast the targets as actual elements to use things like `.value` properly.

`let currentTarget = e.target as HTMLInputElement;`

## Inlay hints

Kind of wish I had this enabled before converting everything but there is a feature in VSCode which inlays the inferred types inline so you can see if they match with the actual types you want!

To enable them search for `typescript inlay` in Settings and enable the ones you want. I enabled everything ðŸ˜‡

You can also configure the color with
```json
"editorInlayHint.background": "red",
"editorInlayHint.foreground": "black"
```

## cssText

Apparently .style doesn't work in Typescript so you have to type .style.cssText instead!
