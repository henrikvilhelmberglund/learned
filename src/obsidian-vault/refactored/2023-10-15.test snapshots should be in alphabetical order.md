I submitted a [PR](https://github.com/unocss/unocss/pull/3237) and was surprised (not really) when CI failed, it turns out snapshots should be in alphabetical order.

...makes sense!

I also learned that you shouldn't really type the snapshots by hand, it's easier to add a test, run it, see what comes in (vs what the snapshot was before), if it was the correct thing just copy paste the snapshot. And place it in alphabetical order. ðŸ˜Š
