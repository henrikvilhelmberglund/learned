When using packages from (in particular) the Vue ecosystem it is likely that they use `unbuild`. Sometimes you can see in the `package.json` something like `"dev": "unbuild --stub"`. 

You can run this to build the package in stub mode which basically allows it to run using [jiti](https://github.com/unjs/jiti). This allows you to edit your code and not have to rebuild and also doesn't need you to run any watch process either.

You can then **link** the package to test it in an actual project. The syntax differs a bit depending on the package manager you use. For npm it's `npm link` in the source package and `npm link <packagename>` in the consuming project. For bun it's `bun link` in the source package and you get some instructions in the console.
