title: Getting value from input using Typescript without intermediate variable
---

It is possible to get a value directly from an input element without using an intermediate variable.

First in the event arguments add `e: Event`.
Then simply do `const value = (<HTMLInputElement>e.target).value` which will cast the target as an input element (or whatever you want) that allows you to do `.value`. Easy!
