There are two interesting methods: .call() and .bind()

Using function.call() it's possible to specify what the `this` value will be.

There's also a more modern function.bind() which returns a new function. This one also has a `this` that can be specified. 

You can also do `function.bind(function, alreadySetValue)` for partial functions with pre specified arguments.
