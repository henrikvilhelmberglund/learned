I was asked to add a changeset when submitting a PR. There was a nice guide here:
[changesets/docs/adding-a-changeset.md at main Â· changesets/changesets (github.com)](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md)

1. Run `npx changeset`
2. Select the packages using arrows and space to select, enter to confirm. (in monorepo)
3. Select what kind of bump you want (major, minor or patch).
4. Provide a message. Optional, add markdown to make it look nicer.
5. Commit!
