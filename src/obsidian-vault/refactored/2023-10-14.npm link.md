I wanted to make a change in a package and then use the package in my other project to see if my change fixed a bug.

I was wondering how to do that but it was pretty easy:

1. In the forked project, run `npm link`.
2. In the other project, run `npm link forked-package-name-here`.
3. Now you can use your forked package as a dependency in your other project!

I also think you need to run `npm unlink` at some point.
